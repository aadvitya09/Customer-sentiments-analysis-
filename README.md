CUSTOMER SENTIMENTS ANALYSIS 

Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the sentiment or opinion expressed in a piece of text. In this case, we'll focus on performing sentiment analysis on customer reviews. We'll use Python and some common libraries like NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and sklearn for this task.

Techniques used in sentiment analysis include natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and text analytics to classify opinions as positive or  negative . Tools like sentiment analysis APIs, sentiment lexicons, and machine learning algorithms like logistic regression are  employed for this purpose. Additionally, sentiment analysis cis applied across various channels such as social media, surveys, customer support interactions, and online reviews to gather comprehensive insights into customer sentiment.
